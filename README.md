# Public Facing Portfolio

> This is a curated compilation of projects I have worked on. Each top-level folder is its own project. None are projects  
that are reproduced in their entirety, but there is enough description to provide a general outline of their motivation and 
scope. In a few cases, I have included reports describing the results of the projects. 

> If you wish to review any of the projects in more detail, please send me an email with your contact information (valid email), and reason you want to look at them.
