# Public Facing Portfolio

> This is a curated compilation of projects I have worked on. Each top-level folder is its own project. None of them are projects or reports 
that are complete in them selves, but there is enough detail to give you a sense of their scope.

> If you wish to review any of the projects in their full glory, please send me an email with your contact information (valid email), and reason you want to look at them.
