### Consolidated Clinical Document (CCD) Renderer

Developed an xslt transform with embedded Javascript and callbacks to a .NET application to render a CCD in a user-friendly format. The transform is largely derived from the [LantanaGroup](http://github.com/lantanagroup) with these additional features:
- collapsing
- hiding sections
