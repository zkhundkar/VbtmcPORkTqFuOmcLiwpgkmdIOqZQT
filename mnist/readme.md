# MNIST with Keras/Tensorflow on GPU

>This is intended as a walk-through of classification as an introduction to neural networks and deep learning.
The dataset is the well-known MNIST dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of isolated handwritten digits that has been well 
studied in the literature. The methods I employ here are gathered from textbooks or online tutorials as simple 
illustrations of how they can be applied using Keras. My goal is to use this notebook as a template for experimenting 
with parameters and architectures to gain some intuition in this area.
